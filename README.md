[API doc](https://motiva-mock.herokuapp.com) | [One-pager integration doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10r5vizs1PBMFOLZJ1RvJA0MbxVqC6wBGtrS1zXpX3T8)

## Usage

### Deployment

This repository is linked to our CI platform for continuous integration and
deployment. The latest `master` commit that passes is deployed to Heroku automatically.

Some environment variables and a YAML file pointing to the gateway paths will
need to be set. See `Configuration` section.

#### Configuration

A environment variable is used to specify the gateway host.

- `GATEWAY_HOST`, host of the gateway server that this app will be using, e.g. `https://api.example.com`

A separate [endpoints.yml](/resources/endpoints.yml) file is used to configure the relative endpoints to the gateway.

### Local Development

```
$ lein ring server
```
